# Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis
This repository contains a SQL-based data analysis project for **Rockbuster Stealth LLC**, a former global movie rental company that is transitioning from physical stores to an online video rental service to compete with platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime.

As part of the Business Intelligence (BI) team, the goal of this project is to:
	•	Load Rockbuster’s historical data into a relational database (RDBMS)
	•	Explore and understand key data points such as inventory, customers, and rentals
	•	Run SQL queries to answer ad-hoc business questions for different departments
	•	Generate insights that will guide Rockbuster’s launch strategy for its digital platform
	•	Compile findings into a format suitable for presentation to the Management Board

This project highlights practical data exploration, querying, and business insight generation using SQL, reflecting how data analytics supports real-world business decisions.
